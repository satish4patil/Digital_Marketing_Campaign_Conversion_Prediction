Machine Learning supervised classification problem. Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key insights. Trained 
models with 10 algorithms, identifying XGBoost (with hyperparameter tuning) as the best-performing model with 87% accuracy. 
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), handled imbalanced data (using SMOTE), feature engineering, recursive feature 
elimination (RFE), and Cross-Validation & Hyperparameter Tuning. Deployed the model using Streamlit for real-time 
predictions.
